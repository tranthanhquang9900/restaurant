        HAVE A LARGE PARTY? WANT TO SIMPLIFY THE ORDERING?
      </h3>

      <p>
      Packages are great if you have a larger group and one person is paying for the entire party.
      When packages are ordered, it allows the host to know how much they are spending ahead of time...even with the tax and gratuity.
      They're also great if you would like to combine multiple courses and simplify the choices for the guests in the party.
      Please contact a manager if you would like to go over the package options for your party.
      </p>

      <p>
      The ordering of entrees will still be done with your server the night.
      All other courses (ex: appetizers and salads) will flow out to the guests in the appropriate timing.
      Please see below for our three popular packages.
