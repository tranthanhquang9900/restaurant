          <p><strong>The Tiki Terrace was founded in April of 2003 by brothers, Scott, Jim and Phil Zuziak.  It was their intention to bring Hawaii to the Chicago-land area through the sights, tastes and sounds of Polynesia.  All three brothers have a background in Polynesian drum & dance and have performed and competed in Samoan fire knife dancing competitions.  The Tiki Terrace is a result of their passion for Polynesian culture all while reflecting their background with hand crafted décor and  Hawaiian style local cooking. We have had the honor of being featured on many television shows, the latest being Chicago's Best!  Please watch the WGN featured video below to get a taste of what a visit to The Tiki Terrace is like.</strong></p>
